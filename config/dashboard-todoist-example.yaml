# Example Todoist Integration Configuration
# =========================================
# This shows how to add Todoist tasks to your groups

# First, you'll need to get your Todoist API token:
# 1. Go to https://todoist.com/app/settings/integrations/developer
# 2. Copy your API token
# 3. Add it to your .env file as TODOIST_API_TOKEN

# Example configuration with Todoist integration:

dashboard:
  title: "Slate with Todoist"
  theme: "tokyo-night"
  columns: 12
  gap: "1rem"

# Global Todoist settings (optional)
todoist:
  apiToken: "${TODOIST_API_TOKEN}"  # Reference from environment variable
  projectName: "Dashboard"          # Default project name

components:
  # Example: Search & Discovery Group with Todoist tasks
  - id: "search-discovery-group"
    type: "group"
    title: "Search & Discovery"
    position: 
      row: "2"
      column: "1 / 7"
    items:
      # Regular links
      - type: "link"
        name: "Google"
        url: "https://google.com"
        icon: "üîç"
        description: "Search engine"
      
      - type: "link"
        name: "DuckDuckGo"
        url: "https://duckduckgo.com"
        icon: "ü¶Ü"
        description: "Privacy-focused search"
        
      # Todoist tasks with #search tag
      - type: "todoist"
        config:
          apiToken: "${TODOIST_API_TOKEN}"  # Can be set globally or per-item
          tag: "search"                     # Show tasks tagged with #search
          projectName: "Dashboard"          # From Dashboard project
          maxTasks: 3                       # Show max 3 tasks

  # Example: Productivity Group with different tag
  - id: "productivity-group"
    type: "group"
    title: "Productivity Tools"
    position: 
      row: "3"
      column: "1 / 7"
    backgroundColor: "#2d1b54"
    items:
      - type: "link"
        name: "Notion"
        url: "https://notion.so"
        icon: "üìù"
        
      - type: "link"
        name: "Todoist"
        url: "https://todoist.com"
        icon: "‚úÖ"
        
      # Todoist tasks with #productivity tag
      - type: "todoist"
        config:
          tag: "productivity"
          projectName: "Dashboard"
          maxTasks: 5

  # Example: Development Group with #dev tag
  - id: "dev-group"
    type: "group"
    title: "Development"
    position: 
      row: "2"
      column: "7 / -1"
    items:
      - type: "link"
        name: "GitHub"
        url: "https://github.com"
        icon: "üêô"
        
      - type: "link"
        name: "VS Code"
        url: "vscode://open"
        icon: "üíª"
        
      # Show development tasks
      - type: "todoist"
        config:
          tag: "dev"
          maxTasks: 4

  # You can also add Todoist as a standalone widget
  - id: "todoist-widget"
    type: "widget"
    widget: "todoist"
    position:
      row: "4"
      column: "1 / 5"
    config:
      tag: "urgent"  # Show all urgent tasks
      maxTasks: 10

# How it works:
# 1. Add tasks in Todoist to your "Dashboard" project
# 2. Tag them with #search, #productivity, #dev, etc.
# 3. Tasks will automatically appear in the matching groups
# 4. The list updates every 5 minutes

# Example Todoist task:
# "Research new search tools #search"
# This will appear in the Search & Discovery group

# Tips:
# - Use environment variables for API tokens (don't commit them!)
# - Each group can have its own tag filter
# - Tasks are displayed as simple text items with checkboxes
# - Click on a task to mark it complete (opens Todoist)
