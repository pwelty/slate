create_issue "üîÑ Consolidate duplicate widgets between core/ and src/scripts/widgets/ directories" \
"## Description
Remove code duplication by consolidating widgets that exist in both directories.

## Issue Type
Task - Code refactoring and architecture cleanup

## Impact
**V1 Blocker** - Code duplication creates maintenance issues and potential bugs

## Current State
- Widgets duplicated in core/ and src/scripts/widgets/

create_issue "üîí Implement input validation, secure API key handling, and CSP headers" \
"## Description
Harden security by implementing proper input validation, secure API key management, and Content Security Policy headers.

## Issue Type
Security - Critical security hardening for production

## Impact
**V1 Blocker** - Security vulnerabilities must be addressed before public release

## Security Gaps Analysis
- User input not validated or sanitized (XSS risk)
- API keys stored in plain text in configuration files

- Potential for injection attacks in YAML parsing

## Goals
- Secure application against common web vulnerabilities
- Protect user data and API credentials
- Implement defense-in-depth security model
- Pass basic security audit requirements

## Vulnerability Assessment
- **XSS Risk**: Unvalidated input in widgets and configuration
- **Credential Exposure**: API keys in plain text
- **DoS Risk**: No rate limiting on external API calls
- **Injection Risk**: YAML parsing without validation

## Tasks

- [ ] Secure API key storage and handling (environment variables, encryption)
- [ ] Add Content Security Policy headers
- [ ] Implement XSS protection and output sanitization
- [ ] Add rate limiting for external API calls
- [ ] Security audit of all endpoints and user inputs
- [ ] Implement YAML configuration validation
- [ ] Add HTTPS enforcement

- API keys are properly secured (not in plain text)
- CSP headers are configured and tested
- XSS protection implemented and tested
- Rate limiting prevents API abuse
- Security audit passes with no critical findings
- All security headers properly configured

## Priority
Critical - Security is essential for v1
