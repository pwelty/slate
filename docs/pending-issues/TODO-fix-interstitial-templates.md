# TODO: Fix Interstitial {{ }} Visible in Live Server During Build

## Issue Description
During the build process, template variables like `{{ }}` become visible in the live server before they are properly rendered. This creates a poor user experience as users see raw template syntax momentarily.

## Context
- Identified during dashboard_renderer.py testing
- Affects live server deployments during build updates
- Users see `{{ variable_name }}` before template rendering completes

## Priority
- [x] Medium (affects user experience)

## Estimated Effort
- [x] Medium (2-8 hours)

## Implementation Notes
Potential solutions:
1. **Atomic Builds**: Build to a temporary directory, then swap atomically
2. **Template Pre-processing**: Pre-render templates before serving
3. **Loading Screens**: Show a loading overlay during builds
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Hide incomplete elements until fully rendered

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] No raw template variables ({{ }}) visible during builds
- [ ] Smooth transition between old and new builds
- [ ] No flickering or flash of unrendered content
- [ ] Build process remains fast and efficient
- [ ] Live server maintains good user experience during updates

## Technical Approach
1. Investigate current template rendering timing
2. Implement atomic build directory swapping
3. Add transition states or loading indicators
4. Test with live server during active builds
5. Verify user experience improvements
